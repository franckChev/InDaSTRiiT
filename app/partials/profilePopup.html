                    The mango is a juicy stone fruit belonging to the genus Mangifera, consisting of numerous tropical
                    fruiting trees, cultivated mostly for edible fruit. The majority of these species are found in
                    nature as wild mangoes. They all belong to the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae. The mango is
                    native to South and Southeast Asia, from where it has been distributed worldwide to become one of
                    the most cultivated fruits in the tropics.

                    The highest concentration of Mangifera genus is in the western part of Malesia (Sumatra, Java and
                    Borneo) and in Burma and India. While other Mangifera species (e.g. horse mango, M. foetida) are
                    also grown on a more localized basis, Mangifera indica—the "common mango" or "Indian mango"—is the
                    only mango tree commonly cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions.

                    It originated in Indian subcontinent (present day India and Pakistan) and Burma. It is the national
                    fruit of India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and the national tree of Bangladesh. In several
                    cultures, its fruit and leaves are ritually used as floral decorations at weddings, public
                    celebrations, and religious ceremonies.
